## _Warning: This is very opinion based!!!_

I created this boilerplate template because I find myself always repeating doing all those stuff

What's included:  


1. Webpack configuration for  
    1. file-loader
    1. html-webpack-plugin
    1. mini-css-extract-plugin
    1. ts-loader
    5. webpack-dev-server
1. TypeScript configuration for React
3. Prettier configuration for my usual styles


Maybe I'll add an ESLint and Babel Configuration later.
